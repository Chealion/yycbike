# #yycbike Counter

Collection of scripts and bits and bobs I used to create [http://calgary.bike](http://calgary.bike) and the [yycbike_count](https://twitter.com/yycbike_count) Twitter bot.

## Thank You

Thanks to the City of Calgary and the team working on the project for making this data public. Thanks to those members of the public who pushed for this data to be made available. Awesome to have timely easy access to the data.

## Tweet Information

Two tweets are sent out each day:

1 - A total and the top 3 counters of on street counters.  
2 - A total and the top 3 counters of pathway counters.  

On street counters: 5th St SW, 7th St SW, 8 Ave SW, 9 Ave SE, 10 St NW, 12 Ave 
Pathway counters: Peace Bridge, Riverwalk, Nose Creek at Bow River, Lindsay Park, N Glennore Park, SE Glenmore Park, Nose Hill, Memorial Drive E of Prince's Island, Memorial Drive at 19th St NW, Memorial Drive at 29th St NW  

The total value is best used as a comparison to itself over the course of time.

## How does it run?

The script nows runs via GitHub Actions. If you want to run your own, you can use the workflow in the .github folder and note you will need to make 4 secrets corresponding to the Twitter credentials.
## Source Data Notes

Environment Canada's data is available as hourly readings (a month's worth), or as daily readings (a year's worth). I use Station 50430 (the Airport)

    Hourly Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Year=2016&Month=06&Day=07&submit=Download+Data&timeframe=1
    Daily Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Prov=AB&dlyRange=2012-07-09&7C2016-06-07&Year=2016&Month=06&Day=07&submit=Download+Data&timeframe=2

Eco-Counter has an API and is documented at https://developers.eco-counter.com/
The data in question is owned by the City of Calgary. The counts are posted once a day normally between 5:00 and 6:00 AM MST, so the counts are **not** live.

Website API Breakdown:

    Individual Data Sets:
    https://www.eco-visio.net/api/aladdin/1.0.0/pbl/publicwebpageplus/data/[ID]?idOrganisme=[CITY]&idPdc=[ID]&fin=DD/MM/YYY&debut=DD/MM/YYYY&interval=[NUMBER]&flowIds=[COMPONENT_ID,COMPONENT_ID,COMPONENT_ID]
    Alternative from dedicated pages:

    Data Set Names for Installation and the Public Page Details:
    https://www.eco-visio.net/api/aladdin/1.0.0/pbl/publicwebpage/[Installation_ID]?withNull=true

The installation details call provides a valid token that can be used for the
individual data sets.

The step number can be 1 (15 minute), 2 (30 minute), 3 (hourly), 4 (daily), 5 (weekly),
6 (monthly) or 7 (annual).

## File Listing

### twitterBot.py

The script that runs the #yycbike\_count Twitter feed. Runs once a day. Tweets a summary with the 3 busiest counters, and one with the numbers for each major route. If multiple counters are on a route - choses the midpoint/median.

### Archived Files

This project used to also store weather and count data into Graphite. These scripts are no longer updated.
