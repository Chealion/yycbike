## Thank You

Thanks to the City of Calgary and the team working on the project for making this data public. Thanks to those members of the public who pushed for this data to be made available. Awesome to have timely easy access to the data.

## Source Data Notes

Environment Canada's data is available as hourly readings (a month's worth), or as daily readings (a year's worth). I use Station 50430 (the Airport)

    Hourly Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/bulkdata_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Prov=AB&hlyRange=2012-07-09&7C2014-01-01&Year=2014&Month=1&Day=1&timeframe=1&submit=Download+Data
    Daily Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climateData/bulkdata_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Prov=AB&dlyRange=2012-07-97&7C2015-01-01&Year=2015&Month=1&Day=1&timeframe=2&submit=Download+Data

Eco-Counter has a private API that can be figured out by reading the AJAX requests performed on each of the counter pages. The data in question is owned by the City of Calgary. The counts are posted once a day normally between 5:00 and 6:00 AM MST, so the counts are *not* live.

    Individual Data Sets:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/h7q239dd/data/periode/[ID]/?begin=YYYYMMDD&endYYYYMMDD&step=[NUMBER]
    Data Set Names for Installation:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/h7q239dd/counter/channels/[ID]
    Public Page Details:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/dfd15sd1ds/public/page/[ID]

The step ID can be 2 (daily), 3 (hourly), or 4 (15 minute).
