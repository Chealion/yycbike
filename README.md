## Thank You

Thanks to the City of Calgary and the team working on the project for making this data public. Thanks to those members of the public who pushed for this data to be made available. Awesome to have timely easy access to the data.

## Tweet Information

Four tweets are sent out each day:

1 - A total and the top 3 counters of on street counters.
2 - A total and the top 3 counters of pathway counters.
3 - A more detailed tweet of on street counters with the middle counters for routes with multiple counters.
4 - A more detailed tweet of pathway counters less likely to be in the Top 3

On street counters: 5th St Sw, 7th St Sw, 8 Ave, 9 Ave, 10 St, 12 Ave
Pathway counters: Peace Bridge, Riverwalk, Nose Creek at Bow River, Lindsay Park, N Glennore Park, SE Glenmore Park, Nose Hill, Memorial Drive E of Prince's Island, Memorial Drive at 19th St NW, Memorial Drive at 29th St NW

The total value is best used as a comparison to itself over the course of time.

## Source Data Notes

Environment Canada's data is available as hourly readings (a month's worth), or as daily readings (a year's worth). I use Station 50430 (the Airport)

    Hourly Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Year=2016&Month=06&Day=07&submit=Download+Data&timeframe=1
    Daily Data:
    http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/bulk_data_e.html?format=csv&stationID=50430&Prov=AB&dlyRange=2012-07-09&7C2016-06-07&Year=2016&Month=06&Day=07&submit=Download+Data&timeframe=2

Eco-Counter has a private API that can be figured out by reading the AJAX requests performed on each of the counter pages. The data in question is owned by the City of Calgary. The counts are posted once a day normally between 5:00 and 6:00 AM MST, so the counts are **not** live.

API Breakdown:

    Individual Data Sets:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/cw6Xk4jW4X4R/data/periode/[ID]/?begin=YYYYMMDD&endYYYYMMDD&step=[NUMBER]
    Data Set Names for Installation:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/cw6Xk4jW4X4R/counter/channels/[ID]
    Public Page Details:
    http://www.eco-public.com/api/cw6Xk4jW4X4R/public/page/[ID]

The step ID can be 2 (daily), 3 (hourly), or 4 (15 minute).
